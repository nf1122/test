Conditions..::..IsAttackedAndCannotIgnore Property 
Get a value indicating whether the character is attacked and can't ignore. The result is based on the bot configurations, not on what happens in the game (the character can be attacked but returned false depending on the options). To force to return false use ForceIgnoreIsAttacked.
